## About this project
- The dashboard covers the period from 2001 to 2020 and utilizes various graph types such as bar charts, line charts, and pie charts for visualization.
- The interactive features of the dashboard, including drill-downs, slicers, and filters, allow users to explore specific states, years, and criteria for deeper insights.
- The analysis reveals that Maharashtra, Odisha, and Madhya Pradesh have the highest number of suicides in India.
- Over the past two decades, student suicides in India have been increasing, with male students being more affected than females.
